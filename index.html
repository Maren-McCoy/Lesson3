        <h1>Mars McCoy</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>My name is Bella Maren McCoy, but i go by Mars.  I am currently in my second year at Wake Tech, pursuing an Associate of Applied Science degree in Advertising and Graphic Design. Though my original plan was to become a dental hygienist, I decided to work towards becoming a graphic designer to put my creative talents to good use. My goal as a future graphic designer is to work in product design fields, designing merchandise for companies and franchises, and possibly opening a successful online shop for my pieces.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve been told I’ve always been artistic and creative, like many of my family members before me. I love drawing digitally and posting my pieces to my Instagram, as well as doing commissions and pin making. A lot of my artistic talent comes from my Dad, who is also a graphic designer. He has taught and helped me a lot over the years. I have also been lucky enough to have had a lot of support and resources from my family and friends. With all of this in mind, I thought it only made sense that I go to school for graphic design..</p>

          <p>I were challenged with creating a logo with an ampersand, which was a little difficult due to creating a logo focused around an ampersand sign but also fun.  </p>
